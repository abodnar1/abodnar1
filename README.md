### Hi, I'm Amber!
I'm a Front-End Software Engineer with a previous career in Customer Service Management in the natural foods industry. I'm looking to connect with cutting-edge companies that share my passion for creating accessible applications and promote diversity and equality in the workplace. In my free time, you can find me recharging my soul through rollerblading, live music, dancing, and sunshine.
